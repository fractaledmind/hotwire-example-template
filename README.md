# Hotwire: Dynamic forms with Stimulus

Imagine a page to share a Document with varying levels of access. Marking a
Document as "publish" grants public access, marking it as "draft" limits access
to the document's creator, and marking it as "passcode protected" grants access
to anyone who knows the passcode.

A missing "passcode" value shouldn't block the creation of a Document with
"publish"- or "draft"-level access. Likewise, a Document marked with "passcode
protected" access without a "passcode" value is invalid.

Interactivity is a core selling point for client-side rendering frameworks.
Their value propositions are at their most compelling when they demonstrate
their ability to change a page's shape and content in response to end-user
actions.

If we built this page with a client-side rendering framework, our form could
store the selected level of access in-memory as a JavaScript object. We could
use that stored value to determine whether or not to render parts of the page to
collect a "passcode" value. In response to a change in the access level, our
framework could re-render the pertinent portions of the page, all without
additional communication with the server.

Unfortunately, server-side rendering frameworks don't have that luxury. The
server renders the page once, and only once when responding to an HTTP request.
If we built a version of this feature with a server-side rendering framework,
what would it take to achieve a similar level of interactivity and network
efficiency?

## Progressively enhancing server-generated HTML

We'll start by establishing a baseline version that renders HTML retrieved over
HTTP without any JavaScript. Our version will rely on the server to _always_
render _all_ of the form's fields, including those that collect the "passcode".

Our initial version will rely on full-page navigations and round-trips to the
server to fetch updated HTML. It'll even work in the absence of JavaScript.

Once we've established a foundation, we'll [progressively enhance][] the form
with JavaScript, making it more interactive with each incremental improvement.

The code samples shared in this article omit the majority of the applicationâ€™s
setup. The initial code was generated by executing `rails new`. The rest of the
[source code][] from this article (including a [suite of tests][]) can be found
on GitHub, and is best read [commit-by-commit][].

## Our starting point

We'll declare a `Document` model backed by [Active Record][]. The `Document`
class defines an [enumeration][] to outline the possible levels of access,
accepts [Action Text][] `content`, and declares presence [validations][]:

```ruby
class Document < ApplicationRecord
  enum :access, publish: 0, draft: 1, passcode_protected: 2

  has_rich_text :content

  with_options presence: true do
    validates :content
    validates :passcode, if: :passcode_protected?
  end
end
```

[Active Record]: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html
[Action Text]: https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html
[enumeration]: https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html
[validations]: https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html

Our `Document` records are managed by a conventional `DocumentsController`
class:

```ruby
# app/controllers/documents_controller.rb

class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @document = Document.new
  end

  def create
    @document = Document.new document_params

    if @document.save
      redirect_to document_url(@document)
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  def show
    @document = Document.find params[:id]
  end

  private

  def document_params
    params.require(:document).permit(
      :access,
      :passcode,
      :content,
    )
  end
end
```

The `app/views/documents/new.html.erb` template collects the `Document` records'
access level through a [group][] of [`<input type="radio">`][radio] elements,
collects the `content` through an Action Text-powered [`<trix-editor>`][trix]
element, and submits the [`<form>`][form] element as a `POST` request to the
`DocumentsController#create` action:

<%# app/views/documents/new.html.erb %>

<section class="w-full max-w-lg">
  <h1>New document</h1>

  <%= form_with model: @document do |form| %>
    <%= render partial: "errors", object: @document.errors %>

    <%= field_set_tag "Access" do %>
      <%= form.collection_radio_buttons :access, Document.accesses.keys, :to_s, :humanize do |builder| %>
        <span>
          <%= builder.radio_button %>
          <%= builder.label %>
        </span>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <%= field_set_tag "Passcode protected" do %>
      <%= form.label :passcode %>
      <%= form.text_field :passcode %>
    <% end %>

    <%= form.label :content %>
    <%= form.rich_text_area :content %>

    <%= form.button %>
  <% end %>
</section>
```

When the submission is valid, the record is created, the data is written to the
database, and the controller serves an [HTTP redirect response][redirect] to the
`DocumentsController#show` action.

When the submission's data is invalid, the controller responds with a [422
Unprocessable Entity][422] status and re-renders the `app/views/documents/new.html.erb`
template to include the `app/views/application/_errors.html.erb` partial. That
partial's [source code][_errors] is omitted here, but draws inspiration from the
template that [Rails scaffolds for new models][scaffolds]:
